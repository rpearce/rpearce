### 👋 Hi, fellow dev!

💜 My mission is to help developers be as productive as possible in their work and their learning. Helping people be the best developers they can be is what drives me to make, share, and teach. If you'd like to support me, check out [my GitHub sponsorship page](https://github.com/sponsors/rpearce/).

🗺️ I'm from Charleston, SC, USA, and I work on, write about, and mentor folx on topics like JavaScript, React, NodeJS, TypeScript, publishing NPM packages / maintaining open source software, functional programming, web accessibility, Haskell, Bash, [Nix](https://nixos.org), and more.

### What am I up to?

* 🌱 learning Go!
* 🔎 working on updates to [`react-medium-image-zoom`](https://github.com/rpearce/image-zoom)

### What have I done recently?

* 🔎 published the long-awaited `v5` of [`react-medium-image-zoom`](https://github.com/rpearce/image-zoom)
* λ paused working on [the free Ramda Guide book](https://ramda.guide) because there aren't enough hours in the day
