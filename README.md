### Hiya!

I'm from Charleston, SC, USA, and I work on and write about projects ranging from web accessibility to JavaScript to [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) to [React](https://reactjs.org) to [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) to Bash to [Nix](https://nixos.org) and beyond.

### What am I up to?

- 🌱 learning [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org)
- ⚡️ building things with [Nix](https://nixos.org)
- ⚙️ recently rewrote my macOS [dotfiles](https://github.com/rpearce/dotfiles) with [Nix](https://nixos.org) and [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)
- λ I write [my personal website/blog](https://github.com/rpearce/robertwpearce.com) using [hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/) and build it with [Nix](https://nixos.org)
- 🌈 soon will be writing on web accessibility at https://dear-dia11y.com
- 🔭 had to pause a big release for 🔎[image-zoom](https://github.com/rpearce/image-zoom)🔍 to redefine where that project is going; please be patient, folks
