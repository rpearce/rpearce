### 👋 Hi, fellow dev!

💜 My mission is to help developers be as productive as possible in their work and their learning. Helping people be the best developers they can be is what drives me to make, share, and teach. If you'd like to support me, check out [my GitHub sponsorship page](https://github.com/sponsors/rpearce/).
